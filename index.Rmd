#About me

Currently, I'm the first year student at Columbia University, Mailman School of Public Health, with the major of M.S. in Biostatistics. I earned my Bachelor degree at University of Wisconsin-Madison with the major of Mathematics. During my spare time, I like playing basketball and my favourite NBA player is LeBron James. Let's go Lakers!!
